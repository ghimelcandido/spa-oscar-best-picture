        <h1>American Fiction</h1>
        <p>Thelonious “Monk” Ellison’s writing career has stalled because his work isn’t 
            deemed “Black enough.” Monk, a writer and English professor, writes a satirical 
            novel under a pseudonym, aiming to expose the publishing world’s hypocrisies. 
            The book’s immediate success forces him to get deeper enmeshed in his assumed identity and 
            challenges his closely-held worldviews.
